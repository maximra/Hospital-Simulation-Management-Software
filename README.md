# Hospital-Simulation-Management-Software
This project simulates a hospital. It is important to note that the longer the simulation is (in days), the more space the files will take.
The simulation has the capability to launch a new simulation each time you start the program or if the user wishes, he/she can restore the 
previous simulation.
You can access the generated data both through the user interface or you can just open the excel files themselves.
